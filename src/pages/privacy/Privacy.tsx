          before utilizing any service provided by Sebaghar.com, each user must

        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside pl-4 text-[#555a64]">
          <li>
            You are a citizen of Bangladesh, 18 years of age or older, or have
            obtained full consent and proper guidance from a fully adult member
            of your family to use all the services of Sebaghar.com.
            Alternatively, you are using this service for a member of your
            family who is fully aware of it. Furthermore, if the person is a
            child or a minor, you are their legal guardian.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are a valid citizen of Bangladesh or a legally resident person
            in Bangladesh.
          </li>
          <li>
            During the period of using Sebaghar services, you will not engage in
            any activity that is against the national interest, against public
            interest, or causes any harm to the state. Additionally, you will
            refrain from engaging in activities that may demean or insult
            anyone's religion, ethnicity, or personal matters through this
            service. If such incidents occur through the Sebaghar service, you
            will be solely responsible.
          </li>
          <li>
            All your information provided for using Sebaghar services, including
            name, date of birth, blood group, gender, weight, and other relevant
            information, will be considered true and will be safeguarded
            according to our Privacy & Policy. Sebaghar will not be responsible
            for any consequences arising from any errors in the provided
            information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Since Sebaghar services are technology-dependent and subject to many
            limitations and errors due to technology, if any problem arises that
            is not easily solvable due to technological errors, Sebaghar will
            not be responsible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sebaghar.com is a public platform where Sebaghar establishes
            connections between service recipients (patients) and service
            providers (doctors). Therefore, there are some terms and conditions
            for availing the services:
          </li>
        </ol>
        <ul className="text-[#555a64] pt-4 pb-4">
          <li className="pb-4">
            a) The service recipient may collect complete personal information
            of the doctor before availing the service. Although Sebaghar
            verifies and authenticates the information of the service providers
            (doctors) themselves and grants them permission to provide services
            at Sebaghar, the service recipient may verify the BMDC ID of the
            service provider (doctor) if desired. If the service recipient
            verifies and authenticates the information and encounters any
            problems, Sebaghar will not be responsible.
          </li>
          <li className="pb-4">
            b) b) Since there is no direct connection between Sebaghar and the
            service provider (doctor), if there is any problem in providing the
            service, Sebaghar will not be responsible. However, if there is any
            problem due to the service provided, appropriate measures will be
            taken against the service provider based on evidence presented by
            the service recipient.
          </li>
          <li className="pb-4">
            c) Since Sebaghar is a telemedicine service, it will not be
            considered as emergency medical care.
          </li>
          <li className="pb-4">
            d) Since the Sebaghar platform does not involve formal diagnosis or
            medical treatment, it only establishes connections with registered
            doctors. Therefore, Sebaghar will not be responsible for any
            physical harm, disability, or life-threatening situation caused by
            consulting a doctor through this platform.
          </li>
          <li className="pb-4">
            e) If the service recipient uses the doctor's advice obtained
            through Sebaghar services on another person and encounters any
            problems due to that advice, Sebaghar will not be responsible.
          </li>
          <li>
            f) Since Sebaghar services depend on the Internet and mobile or
            computer devices, if there is any problem due to the device, the
            service recipient will not get service immediately before or after
            the doctor's specified time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-[#555a64] pt-4">
          These terms and conditions must be agreed upon before using Sebaghar's
          service, and the service recipient and the service provider will be
          solely responsible for any consequences arising from the use of this
          service.
